# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## 1. Dataset Overview
### Description
- **Titanic Dataset**: Includes passenger details such as `pclass`, `sex`, `age`, `fare`, and survival status (`survived`).

### Data Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`name`, `ticket`, `cabin`, etc.).
- Handled missing values:
  - Used the median for numerical columns like `age` and `fare`.
  - Filled missing categorical values (`embarked`) with the mode.
- Encoded categorical variables:
  - `sex` encoded as 0 (female) and 1 (male).
  - `embarked` encoded using `LabelEncoder`.

## 2. Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Description**:
  - Non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm.
  - Predicts based on the majority class of k nearest neighbors.
- **Implementation**:
  - Standardized features using `StandardScaler` for Euclidean distance accuracy.
  - Conducted grid search to optimize `k` (number of neighbors) and distance metrics.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Reported accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Analyzed the impact of scaling on model performance.

### Decision Tree Classifier
- **Description**:
  - Supervised learning algorithm using tree structures for decision-making.
  - Splits data recursively based on feature thresholds to maximize information gain.
- **Implementation**:
  - Used `GridSearchCV` to optimize `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`.
  - Visualized the decision tree to understand feature importance.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Analyzed metrics like Gini impurity and accuracy on training and test sets.
  - Compared overfitting risk for deeper trees.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Description**:
  - Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
  - Utilizes kernel functions (e.g., linear, RBF) for non-linear data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Standardized data using `StandardScaler`.
  - Performed grid search for kernel selection (`linear`, `rbf`) and regularization parameter `C`.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Analyzed how `C` affects the margin width and classification performance.
  - Evaluated test accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- **Description**:
  - Probabilistic model based on Bayes’ Theorem.
  - Assumes feature independence and Gaussian distribution for numerical features.
- **Implementation**:
  - Directly applied to preprocessed data without additional tuning.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessed performance on test data.
  - Highlighted strengths (speed, simplicity) and weaknesses (independence assumption).

## 3. Comparative Analysis

### Performance Comparison
- Compiled results in a table for clarity (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Noted cases where each algorithm excelled or struggled:
  - **KNN**: Sensitive to scaling and choice of `k`.
  - **Decision Tree**: High interpretability but prone to overfitting.
  - **SVM**: Strong with well-separated data, struggles with large datasets.
  - **Naive Bayes**: Fast but limited by its independence assumption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Strengths**:
  - Simple to implement and interpret.
  - Non-parametric (makes no assumption about data distribution).
  - Effective for smaller datasets.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Computationally expensive as the dataset size increases.
  - Sensitive to irrelevant or unscaled features.
  - Requires careful selection of `k` and distance metric.

#### Naive Bayes
- **Strengths**:
  - Fast to train and test.
  - Handles categorical data well.
  - Performs well on high-dimensional datasets.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Strong independence assumption may not hold true.
  - Can struggle with continuous variables unless discretized.
  - Lower F1-scores if features are highly interdependent.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Strengths**:
  - Effective for datasets with complex relationships.
  - Provides robust performance with proper kernel selection.
  - Works well in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Computationally expensive, especially with non-linear kernels.
  - Sensitive to hyperparameters and feature scaling.
  - Limited interpretability.

#### Decision Tree
- **Strengths**:
  - Easy to understand and visualize.
  - Captures non-linear relationships well.
  - No need for feature scaling.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Prone to overfitting without proper constraints (e.g., max depth, minimum samples).
  - Sensitive to small changes in data.
  - Can produce biased trees if the dataset is imbalanced.

## Conclusion
In this analysis, we evaluated four machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)—on the Titanic dataset. Each algorithm exhibited unique strengths and limitations, influenced by the dataset's characteristics, preprocessing techniques, and specific parameter settings.

- Preprocessing significantly impacted model performance, particularly for KNN and SVM, which are sensitive to feature scaling.
- Decision Trees stood out for their interpretability but were prone to overfitting with deeper structures.
- SVM showed robust performance with well-separated data but struggled with larger datasets and required extensive tuning.
- Naive Bayes, while simple and computationally efficient, was limited by its assumption of feature independence.

### Future Work
- Explore ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to enhance performance and address observed limitations.
- Conduct advanced hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering to refine results and improve predictive reliability.
